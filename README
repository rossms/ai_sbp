This is a readme for CS510 homework 1

I have implemented this assignment in python. Since python is installed on the tux servers,
the python scripts are able to be executed directly, without being packaged into an executable first.

I have created hw1(.sh) that calls my main.py, so it is even easier.

To run, simply execute ./hw1 in the current directory.

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions: ross@drexel.edu.

Notes:
Breadth-first is very inefficient. It takes about 4-5 minutes on the board 1.
